    <p>Mercedes-Benz AMG E190 W201</p>

    <h1>
      In March 1990, at the Geneva Auto Show, the 190 E 2.5-16 Evolution II was
      shown. With the success of the first Evolution model, this model's
      502-unit production was already sold before it was unveiled.[citation
      needed] This car retailed in 1990 for DM 136,720. The "Evo II" included
      the AMG PowerPack fitted to the same short-stroke 2,463 cc (2.5 L)
      inline-four engine as the Evolution, producing a maximum power output of
      235 PS (173 kW; 232 hp) at 7,200 rpm and 245 N⋅m (181 lb⋅ft) of torque at
      5,000 rpm, as well as a full SLS adjustable suspension allowing the ride
      height to be adjusted from an interior switch. An obvious modification to
      the Evolution II was the radical body kit (designed by Prof. Richard
      Eppler from the University of Stuttgart) with a large adjustable rear
      wing, rear window spoiler, and Evolution II 17-inch alloy wheels. The kit
      served an aerodynamic purpose—it was wind tunnel tested to reduce drag to
      0.29, while at the same time increasing downforce. Period anecdotes tell
      of BMW research and development chief, Wolfgang Reitzle, saying "the laws
      of aerodynamics must be different between Munich and Stuttgart; if that
      rear wing works, we'll have to redesign our wind tunnel." The anecdote
      claims that BMW did redesign its wind tunnel afterwards.[17] 500 examples
      were painted in "blauschwarz" blue/black metallic; the last two examples,
      numbers 501 and 502, were painted in astral silver making them the rarest
      of the Evolution models. The Evo II had the shortest production run of the
      190 series models with production starting in 1990 and ending in 1991.

      The Mercedes-AMG GT is a series of 2-door grand tourers produced by German
      automobile manufacturer Mercedes-AMG. The car was introduced on 9
      September 2014 and was officially unveiled to the public in October 2014
      at the Paris Motor Show.[1] While not directly replacing the SLS AMG
      (competing in a different segment), it is the second sports car developed
      entirely in-house by Mercedes-AMG. The Mercedes-AMG GT went on sale in two
      variants (GT and GT S) in March 2015, while a GT3 racing variant of the
      car was introduced in 2015. A high performance variant called the GT R was
      introduced in 2016. A GT4 racing variant, targeted at semi-professional
      drivers and based on the GT R variant, was introduced in 2017. In 2021, a
      new variant called the AMG GT Black Series was released. All variants are
      assembled at the Mercedes-Benz plant in Sindelfingen, Germany. On 28
      October 2021, Mercedes-Benz announced the new Mercedes-AMG R232 SL-Class
      as the direct successor for the roadster version.[2][3][4] The coupe
      version will be redesigned on the same platform as the 2023 Mercedes AMG
      SL, but will retain the name AMG GT.

    <h1>
      The Mercedes-AMG ONE (R50, previously known as Project One) is a
      limited-production plug-in dual hybrid sports car manufactured by
      Mercedes-AMG, featuring Formula One-derived technology.[4][5] The Project
      One concept car was unveiled at the 2017 International Motor Show Germany
      by the seven-time F1 world champion and Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 driver,
      Lewis Hamilton and Head of Mercedes-Benz, Dieter Zetsche.[6][7] The
      production version of the AMG ONE was unveiled on June 1, 2022 and the
      production began in August.[8] Mercedes-AMG unveiled the concept version
      of the ONE, the Project One with nearly identical specifications to the
      production version. Claimed that the production ONE will be evaluated on
      their performance, durability, and ability in Mercedes-Benz's proving
      grounds and on racing circuits. Development of the AMG ONE took place at
      Mercedes-AMG GmbH, in Affalterbach Germany. Head of Mercedes-AMG, Tobias
      Moers described that when "the time is right", Lewis Hamilton, who has
      worked on the development of the car will join the team of development
      drivers testing prototypes of the car.
