      Facebook is a social media and social networking service owned by the
      American technology conglomerate Meta. Created in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg
      with four other Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin,
      Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name derives from
      the face book directories often given to American university students.
      Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding
      to other North American universities. Since 2006, Facebook allows everyone
      to register from 13 years old (or older), except in the case of a handful
      of nations, where the age limit is 14 years. As of December 2022, Facebook
      claimed 3 billion monthly active users. As of October 2023, Facebook
      ranked as the 3rd most visited website in the world, with 22.56% of its
      traffic coming from the United States. It was the most downloaded mobile
      app of the 2010s. Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet
      connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones. After
      registering, users can create a profile revealing information about
      themselves. They can post text, photos and multimedia which are shared
      with any other users who have agreed to be their friend or, with different
      privacy settings, publicly. Users can also communicate directly with each
      other with Messenger, join common-interest groups, and receive
      notifications on the activities of their Facebook friends and the pages
      they follow. The subject of numerous controversies, Facebook has often
      been criticized over issues such as user privacy (as with the Cambridge
      Analytica data scandal), political manipulation (as with the 2016 U.S.
      elections) and mass surveillance. Facebook has also been subject to
      criticism over psychological effects such as addiction and low
      self-esteem, and various controversies over content such as fake news,
      conspiracy theories, copyright infringement, and hate speech. Commentators
      have accused Facebook of willingly facilitating the spread of such
      content, as well as exaggerating its number of users to appeal to
      advertisers.

      YouTube is an American online video sharing and social media platform
      owned by Google. Accessible worldwide,[note 1] it was launched on February
      14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim, three former
      employees of PayPal. Headquartered in San Bruno, California, United
      States, it is the second most visited website in the world, after Google
      Search. YouTube has more than 2.5 billion monthly users, who collectively
      watch more than one billion hours of videos every day. As of May 2019,
      videos were being uploaded to the platform at a rate of more than 500
      hours of content per minute, and as of 2021, there were approximately 14
      billion videos in total. In October 2006, YouTube was purchased by Google
      for $1.65 billion (equivalent to $2.31 billion in 2023). Google expanded
      YouTube's business model of generating revenue from advertisements alone,
      to offering paid content such as movies and exclusive content produced by
      and for YouTube. It also offers YouTube Premium, a paid subscription
      option for watching content without ads. YouTube incorporated Google's
      AdSense program, generating more revenue for both YouTube and approved
      content creators. In 2022, YouTube's annual advertising revenue increased
      to $29.2 billion, more than $9 billion higher than in 2020. Since its
      purchase by Google, YouTube has expanded beyond the core website into
      mobile apps, network television, and the ability to link with other
      platforms. Video categories on YouTube include music videos, video clips,
      news, short and feature films, songs, documentaries, movie and teaser
      trailers, live streams, vlogs, and more. Most content is generated by
      individuals, including collaborations between "YouTubers" and corporate
      sponsors. Established media, news, and entertainment corporations have
      also created and expanded their visibility to YouTube channels in order to
      reach greater audiences. YouTube has had unprecedented social impact,
      influencing popular culture, internet trends, and creating
      multimillionaire celebrities. Despite its growth and success, the platform
      is sometimes criticized for allegedly facilitating the spread of
      misinformation, the sharing of copyrighted content, routinely violating
      its users' privacy, enabling censorship, endangering child safety and
      wellbeing, and for its inconsistent or incorrect implementation of
      platform guidelines.

      Instagram[a] is a photo and video sharing social networking service owned
      by Meta Platforms. It allows users to upload media that can be edited with
      filters, be organized by hashtags, and be associated with a location via
      geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with preapproved
      followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations,
      view trending content, like photos, and follow other users to add their
      content to a personal feed. A Meta-operated image-centric social media
      platform, it is available on iOS, Android, Windows 10, and the web. Users
      can take photos and edit them using built-in filters and other tools, then
      share them on other social media platforms like Facebook. It supports 32
      languages including English, Spanish, French, Korean, and Japanese.
      Instagram was originally distinguished by allowing content to be framed
      only in a square (1:1) aspect ratio of 640 pixels to match the display
      width of the iPhone at the time. In 2015, this restriction was eased with
      an increase to 1080 pixels. It also added messaging features, the ability
      to include multiple images or videos in a single post, and a Stories
      feature—similar to its main competitor Snapchat—which allowed users to
      post their content to a sequential feed, with each post accessible to
      others for 24 hours. As of January 2019, Stories is used by 500 million
      people daily. Originally launched for iOS in October 2010 by Kevin Systrom
      and Mike Krieger, Instagram rapidly gained popularity, with one million
      registered users in two months, 10 million in a year, and 1 billion by
      June 2018. In April 2012, Facebook Inc. acquired the service for
      approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock. The Android version of
      Instagram was released in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited
      desktop interface in November 2012, a Fire OS app in June 2014, and an app
      for Windows 10 in October 2016. As of October 2015, over 40 billion photos
      had been uploaded. Although often admired for its success and influence,
      Instagram has also been criticized for negatively affecting teens' mental
      health, its policy and interface changes, its alleged censorship, and
      illegal and inappropriate content uploaded by users.
